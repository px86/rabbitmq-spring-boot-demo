* How to Run

Make sure you have =docker= and =docker-compose= installed, then run =docker-compose up -d= in the root folder of the project. It will spin up three docker containers - rabbitmq, producer and consumer.

The =producer= exposes an api endpoint for publishing messages onto the queue.

#+begin_src http
  POST http://<producer>/api/v1/publish
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "body": "hi there!"
  }
#+end_src

The =consumer= logs the received message.
